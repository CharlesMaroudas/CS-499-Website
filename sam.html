							Our team recieved the GitHub repository for the Game of Energy Digital project on Sunday,
							9/17, but some members were unable to open the files correctly. The files were not 
							displaying correctly in Unity and we were not able to run the .exe file that was built
							for the game correctly.
						</p>
						<p>
							On my computer we were eventually able to open the .exe file but it was not working
							correctly either. The .exe displayed a poorly drawn set of shapes that were supposed to
							resemble the game board and there was no functionality at all. We are checking with Nathan
							to see if what we have in these files are what he expected us to be working with.

							We met with Nathan on Thursday, 9/14, to get a hands on experience with the actual board
							game we will be designing. We were able to play the Game of Energy which allowed for 
							team building as well as an overall knowledge of the rules and functions for the game. We
							feel as if the game is well designed and look forward to designing the digital version.

							code.
