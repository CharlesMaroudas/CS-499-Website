							Had a busy week, but I was able to get the nuclear game piece to
							move into place in the same manner that the piece from last
							semester is doing. Updated the script for the inclusion of the piece.
							Also, updated the project GitHub so that it contains the files exactly
							as we are working on them, so there's no need to confusingly drag
							files back and forth to get them into the right place, reducing the
							risk of mixing things up or ending up with nasty merge conflicts.

							The team met this week and went through the process of getting one
							of the pieces to be moveable in game. We added colliders to the hex
							pieces and updated the script responsible for having the pieces snap
							into place to work for this particular type of game piece.
							Unfortunately, the piece can still be placed anywhere, not just in
							the hex grid on the map (the piece that worked from the previous
							semester has the same issue). We decided for now that we are going to
							get all of the pieces to this point, and then try to do some
							debugging to figure out why the pieces aren't placing correctly.

							We met with one of the group members from the previous semester,
							Devon, on Tuesday, the 3rd. Devon was extremely helpful and spent
							about two hours with us, going over the project, explaining how
							his team had been approaching the project, how different components
							were supposed to work, and just giving us general advice based on
							his team's experience working on the project.
						</p>
						<p>
							It sounded like Devon had put a substantial amount of work into making
							the hex grid work for the map, and had been working on getting the
							pieces to lock onto the grid. He managed to get one piece done last
							semester after the time that he spent on the grid. The next step was
							going to be getting that done for the rest of the pieces.
						</p>
						<p>
							Devon was not sure about the state of the cards -- he mentioned that
							someone had been working on them, but that they were unable to get them
							to work in the game. So, that's another area to look into next. After
							we get the rest of the pieces moving into place and the cards working, 
							hopefully we can approach the rest of the gameplay.

							Nathan got back to us on Sunday and told us that he would get in
							contact with the previous group members to see if he could find
							out what we needed to do to get the project to open correctly.
							After not hearing back for a couple of days, we contacted Dr. Hayes,
							and Dr. Hayes was able to get into contact with Mr. Piwowarski for us.
							Mr. Piwowarski had run the class previously, and was able to provide
							us with the files that were submitted to him at the end of the
							semester.
						</p>
						<p>
							From the files that were provided from Mr. Piwowarski, we were able to
							open the project with more success. It looked substantially better -- 
							the background actually looks like a table! We also discovered, after
							looking through some of the source code, that the dice are capable of
							being rolled (though nothing happens with the result just yet), and
							there is a game piece that is capable of being dragged onto the board.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is promising, and substantially better than what we saw before,
							but still not in the state that we imagined from the initial
							description of the state of the project. It sounded as though the
							turns were essentially already in place, and the game was practically
							playable in its current state.

							Nathan added me to the GitHub for the Game of Energy Digital project
							on Sunday, the 17th. The following day, I was able to download the
							project and tried to open the project. I was able to get it to open
							in Unity, but there were duplicate files, and everything was not
							showing up correctly in Unity. The background, for instance, was
							not showing up -- Unity couldn't find the prefab.
						</p>
						<p>
							A day or so later, we were able to open the GameOfEnergy.exe file on
							another computer, and even the .exe was not showing up correctly. We
							contacted Nathan with screenshots of what we were seeing to see if
							it looked like what he had.

							Our team met on Tuesday, 9/12, in order to divide up sections for the project
							planning assignment. We attempted to divide these sections up as evenly as
							possible, but everyone seems open to contributing more as needed. Hopefully
							the sections we assigned are roughly proportional.
						</p>

							We also met on Thursday with Nathan. We met at a local game shop where we had
							the opportunity to play the tabletop version of Game of Energy. The game was an
							enjoyable experience... but we all lost. With any luck, we'll be able to implement
							the game well enough in code so that we are able to play again as often as we'd
							like.

							Additionally, we had our initial meeting with the client, Nathan Wright, on Thursday,
							9/7. We discussed the project in general and received a list of the desired requirements
							for the digital version of Game of Energy.
