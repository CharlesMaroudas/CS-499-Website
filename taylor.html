							Our team established a time to meet once weekly in order to discuss progress and any
							obstacles that might be getting in our way. So far, the work ethic of the group has
							been encouraging.

							Additionally, we had our initial meeting with the client, Nathan Wright, on Thursday,
							9/7. We discussed the project in general and received a list of the desired requirements
							for the digital version of Game of Energy.

							Our team met on Tuesday, 9/12, in order to divide up sections for the project
							planning assignment. We attempted to divide these sections up as evenly as
							possible, but everyone seems open to contributing more as needed. Hopefully
							the sections we assigned are roughly proportional.
						</p>

							We also met on Thursday with Nathan. We met at a local game shop where we had
							the opportunity to play the tabletop version of Game of Energy. The game was an
							enjoyable experience... but we all lost. With any luck, we'll be able to implement
							the game well enough in code so that we are able to play again as often as we'd
							like.
