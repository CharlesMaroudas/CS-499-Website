				<h2>Description from Nathan Wright</h2>
				<p>

You are a captain of industry, and your job is to thwart the fast-approaching energy crisis. Regardless which captain of industry you become, you will have a unique ability that can be used on every turn of the game. Some abilities net you a better return on certain industries, others allow you to manipulate cards and other game components.

As a captain of industry, you have access to all modern day technologies: biofuel, fossil fuel, hydroelectric, nuclear, solar, and wind--all of which have different sizes, costs, and benefits. Each player must make optimum use of their resources and the available hexagonal areas on the board to not only achieve a victory with generating enough energy in terawatt-hours (TWh), which are your victory points in the game, but to do so before time runs out and world goes dark.

In every round of play, each player will take a single turn. During this turn, you will take a series of 3 actions: draw a Grid card (to be played strategically now or later), be “paid” in the amount of energy credits shown on your environmental score track (this is a separate track from the TWh score track), and finally roll the territory die.

Upon rolling the territory die, you can choose which combinations of industries you would like to build ("permit") in that zone of the board. Each zone presents a variety of different permitting costs for the available industries, but keeps all the environmental and TWh score track gains the same between zones--this makes it easier, but still realistic, to compare industries across zones, and also allows you the ability to quickly ascertain which industries have advantages/disadvantages depending on where you choose to build them. Your choices in what you build and when you build them determine your odds of victory in Game of Energy!
